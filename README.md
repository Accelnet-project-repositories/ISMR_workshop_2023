The following repository contains the instructions for the hands-on session of the ISMR workshop 2023. During this workshop you will be utilizing [AMBF simulation](https://github.com/WPI-AIM/ambf) and the [surgical robotics challenge](https://github.com/jabarragann/surgical_robotics_challenge) to collect data for deep network for robotic instrument segmentation. This workshop will be divided into three parts:

1. Software installation - [workshop_preparation](workshop_instructions.md).
2. Data collection using AMBF and the surgical robotics challenge.
3. Neural network training and evaluation - [neural network training](./dVRK_Segmentation_Tutorial.ipynb).
